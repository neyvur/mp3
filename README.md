MP3 Voice Converter Bot

This Telegram bot automatically converts voice messages into MP3 files.
To run this bot, open your terminal and type:

python MP3_bot.py


If you see the message

🤖 бот запущен .... 


it means the bot has started successfully and is working.

Currently, this bot runs locally, which means only I can use it while it’s running on my computer.
Once I close the terminal or turn off my PC, the bot stops working.
To make it available for everyone, it needs to be hosted online on a server such as Render, Railway, or PythonAnywhere, so that it works 24/7 even when my computer is off.

I created this bot because most similar bots that convert Telegram voice messages into MP3 are paid.
I wanted to build a free one that I could use personally without any limits.
When the bot is running, you can simply send a voice message to it, and it will automatically convert the message into an MP3 file that you can download.
